Agentic AI & Multimodal Intelligence Portfolio This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of projects, implementations, and technical documentation developed during the study of Agentic AI. It documents the transition from traditional, passive AI models to autonomous, goal-oriented systems capable of reasoning, planning, and executing complex tasks.

The repository is structured to showcase expertise in two primary domains: Agentic Workflows (how AI reasons and acts) and Vision-Language Alignment (how AI perceives and describes the visual world).

Core Project Modules

Advanced Text Segmentation (5 Levels of Chunking) A deep dive into the foundational data processing layer of Agentic AI. This module explores how to optimize the "memory" of an agent by intelligently splitting data into manageable chunks.
Level 1-2: Basic Character and Recursive splitting for structural integrity.

Level 3: Document-specific logic for Markdown, Python, and JavaScript.

Level 4: Semantic chunking using Embedding-based similarity.

Level 5: Experimental Agentic Chunking, where an LLM agent determines logical topic boundaries.

Vision-Language Fine-tuning (BLIP Architecture) An implementation of domain-specific adaptation for multimodal models. This project demonstrates the fine-tuning of the BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) model to generate high-quality, context-aware image captions.
Objective: Bridging the gap between visual perception and natural language generation.

Mechanism: Utilizing a custom PyTorch pipeline and the transformers library to specialize a pre-trained model on niche datasets.

Technical Stack Frameworks: LangChain, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers.

Models: BLIP, OpenAI Embeddings, GPT-based Reasoning Engines.

Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Scikit-Learn (Cosine Similarity), PIL.

Repository Objectives Autonomous Agency: Exploring the frontier where AI moves beyond simple prompt-response toward independent agency.

Data Optimization: Implementing state-of-the-art RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) preprocessing techniques.

Multimodal Specialization: Demonstrating the ability to adapt general-purpose models for specialized industrial or academic use cases.

Conclusion The projects contained herein reflect a commitment to building AI systems that don't just process information, but understand context, reason through obstacles, and communicate visual data with human-like precision.
